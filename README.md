 Weather forecast using JSON files to fetch data
 View here: https://okellyeneko.github.io/WeatherAppJSON/

 This was created using Javascript / CSS / HTML only. It was created by fetching data from two seperate JSON files with information about weather in Dublin. 
 The information is outdated. However, the code shows data manipulation using JavaScript by extracting relevant data in JSON files.
 The emphasis is put on the JavaScript functionalities, not on the styling.

 The webpage consists of a days input where the user can choose a number between 0 and 5 to display the number of days to show the weather forecast.
 It includes three checkboxes that display additional information in the table if they are checked.

 The table rows also include "more details" buttons that on click trigger a function which displays weather information in blocks of three hours for the clicked row.
