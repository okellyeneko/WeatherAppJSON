 Weather forecast using JSON files to fetch data

 This was created using Javascript / CSS / HTML only. It was created by fetching data from two seperate JSON files with information about weather in Dublin. 

 The emphasis is put on the JavaScript functionalities, not on the styling.

 The information is outdated. However, the code shows data manipulation using JavaScript by extracting relevant data in JSON files.
